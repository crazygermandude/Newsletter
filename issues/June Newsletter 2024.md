**_SPECIAL ANNOUNCEMENT_** 

Anything in regards of awareness will now **ONLY** be in our newsletter. This is to ensure that majority of holidays, special occasions and historical days in that said month can be all in one place. We understand that this might be upsetting for some, however due to unforseen circumstances and miscommunications in the past, we believe this is the best decision for now.

Throughout June, there have been numerous important holidays to recognize and celebrate; Let’s take a look at a few of them!



‧͙⁺ 👨 › **Fathers Day**


Fathers Day is an internationally recognized holiday, meant to honor and acknowledge fathers and the impact they continuously have on our lives. I hope you (if able and applicable) took the time to appreciate and recognize the fathers who play a positive role in their children’s lives.



‧͙⁺ 🫂 › **National Best Friend's Day**


National Best Friend's Day is similar to Father’s Day, or National Siblings Day. On June 8th, many people, both within the Teethyz community and around the world took the time to acknowledge and appreciate the best friends that have positively impacted their lives. The qualities of a best friend can create a welcome change within your life, and I sincerely hope that you took this time to truly show some appreciation to anyone in your life you consider fits this role.



‧͙⁺ ❤️ › **Juneteenth**


Juneteenth is a holiday of severe importance within the United States of America, and should be acknowledged internationally due to its significance. Juneteenth is a day of awareness recognized on June 19th, the anniversary of the Emancipation Proclamation of 1862, which stated all enslaved people were free. On this day I hope you took the time to reflect on the past, acknowledge the horrors of the time and recognize why it’s so important awareness is brought to these events in order for history to never repeat itself.



‧͙⁺ 🇵🇹 › **National Portugese Heritage Month**


National Portuguese Heritage Month is a time to celebrate and honour the beautiful traditions and contributions of the Portuguese community. It's a chance to recognize the history, language, music, dance, and delicious food passed down through generations. This month, we have a unique opportunity to educate others about Portuguese culture and share the achievements and impact of Portuguese Americans in the United States. It's a time for cultural events, community gatherings, and an all-around celebration of our Portuguese heritage and identity.



‧͙⁺ 🌈 › **Pride Month**


Pride Month, which takes place in June, is a significant time for supporting the LGBTQ+ community. It began as a way to remember the Stonewall riots in 1969 and to recognize all the ways LGBTQ+ people have shaped history and culture. During Pride Month, we unite to push for equality and raise awareness about LGBTQ+ rights. It's a time for celebrating our differences and making sure everyone feels accepted. There are events like parades and workshops that help show support and give strength to LGBTQ+ individuals. Pride Month is about spreading love and reminding us that we all deserve respect no matter who we are. It's also a time to highlight the importance of allyship, as allies play a crucial role in standing up for LGBTQ+ rights and creating a more inclusive society.



We hope you enjoyed reading this month's awareness section! Have a lovely day, everyone!

╭˚ʚ݁  **__FATHER’S DAY__**



Greetings, Teeth’yz community! As highlighted earlier in our newsletter, Father’s Day was celebrated this month on June 16th. In honor of this special day, we’ve interviewed several MRs to share their thoughts on what Father’s Day means to them. Enjoy these heartfelt insights!

**What is your favorite memory with your loved one?**

⋮⋮ One of my favourite memories is when I spent time with my loved one in Blackpool. We had an amazing time doing everything, and it bonded us so much more! I still remember it to this day because of the everlasting memories of the different places we went to, where we stayed and how they made that part of my life an experience to remember!

**What gift are you planning to get for your loved one?**

⋮⋮ For my loved one, I got them a bunch of flowers and a silly little card that I wrote a heartfelt letter in! I also got them a small pack of chocolate just as a little sweet treat and a thanks for being there for me throughout the entirety of my life, and when I was at my worst because I appreciate them so much.

A1: Leah and I love VCing together and making matching avatars, even though sometimes she gives me winter options, like hello?! It’s Summer (for us anyways)!! We also host trainings together which is really fun!!!

A2:  Leah is so funny and she always knows when something is wrong and how to cheer me up. She is such a lovely friend and I’m so lucky to have her in my life. She always helps me when I’m not feeling my best and she’s just adorable!!

A3: Even though I find it VERY annoying, she always plays Karma by Jojo Siwa in VC and whenever we’re in a VC with a bunch of people and it plays, I instantly know it was her who played it. Such a memorable moment haha!!!!! One time we were also shifting together and a LR came up to us complimenting our matching avatars and it made us so happy!! We spend like forever trying to find avatars we both like (it’s a struggle), since she has a very very bad taste.

˚ʚ˚ — From: lehoco・ৎ —

A1: We VC alot, and they are quite funny and entertaining. Then, I also drag her to shifts with me. She doesn't enjoy it but oh well! 

A2: She is sometimes kind, but is there for me when I need her and she is sometimes very sweet. 

A3: She is special to me because we were once in Teethyz, and she told me to take a picture with her and bam, we just became close.

A1: I like calling Mina fat.

A2: I really appreciate how supportive and positive Mina can be! I'm always asking her opinion on things and she always just knows what ideas are good and which ones are bad! I think she inspires me to be a more insightive person!

A3: I remember this one time that Mina and I were in a VC in Teethyz and we were talking and laughing with each other. And then this other person joined the VC and we both got so quiet. And it was so funny because I was trying to hold back my laughter and we started DMing each other so agressively. IDK why but it was really funny! 

˚ʚ˚ — From: OceanAvny・ৎ — 

A1: Avery and I love chatting about our lives and new drama that might come up. We could go on for hours, talking about each other, even though we’ve only known each other for a few months.

A2: One trait that Avery has is she shows her love in very interesting ways. It’s hard to explain, although we bicker often, our love exists!

A3: One night, Avery and I started talking about the butterfly effect. We talked for a while about how different things would be if we never met and what we’d be doing.

˚ʚ˚ — From: mckcnzies・ৎ — 

A1: Some activities/traditions Rice and I enjoy doing together would have to be playing Roblox games or our VCs. 

A2: I appreciate how caring Rice is! He's kind to all. He inspires me to be a kinder person and treat others better.

A3: A memorable moment with Rice would be playing 3008 on Roblox with him. It's one of our favorite games, we usually build a fort and I do the interior while he works on the exterior!

˚ʚ˚ — From: the_rice・ৎ —

A1: My fav tradition with Kenzie is how we always say good morning and goodnight to each other and how we always tell each other how our days are going - good or bad.  I also love our matching outfits (that Kenz usually finds)! :).  I love playing roblox and being on call with Kenz and above all just love to talk with her about whatever is on our minds.

A2: Kenzie is such a thoughtful and caring person.  She is always there for me and by my side.  She has such a fun personality and our shared sense of humor lines up so well.  She has inspired me to look up often and to have a more positive lookout - even in the mundane day-to-day things.  I’m so grateful to have her as my best friend!! ☺️

A3: My most memorable moment with Kenzie is when we first started talking. I was going through some personal things and she saw how it was impacting me and immediately came to support me. This theme has continued throughout our friendship as we’re always there for each other whenever one of us isn’t feeling our best :). We have certainly had more memorable moments since then, but this is the one that will always stand out to me.

A2: She is kind, loving, and supportive!! She teaches me to make light out of tough situations.

A3: Shifting and handling trollers together!! <<3

˚ʚ˚ — From: lovqiix・ৎ —

A1: Jan and I love to just shift at the dentist, DMing and making jokes with eachother, etc!

A2: I love how Jan is extremely kind and outgoing, she is beyond caring and supportive as well. I love how she can easily make literally anyone smile, even when they're going through something tough. Jan is one of the sweetest people I have ever met and has influenced me into doing some amazing things for myself and others. 

A3: Jan is special to me for many reasons, but mainly because of her amazing qualities. Like I said, she is extremely caring, kind, supportive, and she has many other awesome qualities. I don't really have any stories or memorable moments to share as we haven't been friends for a super long time, but I am so excited to create more memories with her!
